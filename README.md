# LC_survey

The Library Carpentry Advisory Group (LCAG, https://librarycarpentry.org/advisory/) conducted a survey with the aim to gain a better understanding of librarians and other information professionals in terms of their training needs, impacts resulting from training and further engagement with The Carpentries community. The survey has been developed by Birgit Schmidt and Konrad FÃ¶rstner.

The survey was disseminated through various channels, including The Carpentries mailing lists and social media channels, regional mailing lists (e.g. Australia, Asia, Africa), and direct contacts to former workshop participants and instructors (via host institutions).

The survey consisted of 28 questions overall, and was open for responses between 14 June 2021 and 25 August 2021.
