It messes up the whole spreadsheet if you accidentally choose to separate using a separator that is 'within a column too.' I know OpenRefine & GREL might work, but in the material I do not know how to interpret myself - need a new case, where the data set is poor and 'dirty' within columns, so I can learn to fix this. It seems we get a quite a few data sets from providers, that is looking like this, and it would be nice to be able to clean these data in order to re-use them in other settings","The lessons and community around (Library) Carpentries helped me to get started, for real, to look deeper into Data Science Skills that can benefit the patrons we support. Being an outreach librarian, teaching and presenting, I love to learn new skills in order to better myself and to become self-confident enough in order to approach both students, teachers, researchers, and administrative staff with the knowledge and skills librarians bring to the table. We have to keep learning as support units, otherwise, we might end up being 'bypassed and forgotten'.
The way the Carpentries introduce new (data) skills are both well planned, with a didactic approach, and presented in a pedagogical manner. It is great for self-studies as well as for groups. I hope all university libraries around the world would consider becoming a member since the skills presented in The Carpentries are super relevant for how scholarly communications and research are evolving. Data, Data management, Information management, knowledge management are skills in demand in a university setting, and we as librarians need to know how to adapt these skills and figure out how we best can support when our patrons are asking us.
