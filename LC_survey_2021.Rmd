# Survey results
The Library Carpentry Advisory Group (LCAG, https://librarycarpentry.org/advisory/) conducted a survey with the aim to gain a better understanding of librarians and other information professionals in terms of their training needs, impacts resulting from training and further engagement with The Carpentries community. The survey has been developed by Birgit Schmidt and Konrad FÃ¶rstner.

The survey was disseminated through various channels, including The Carpentries mailing lists and social media channels, regional mailing lists (e.g. Australia, Asia, Africa), and direct contacts to former workshop participants and instructors (via host institutions). 

The survey consisted of 28 questions overall, and was open for responses between `r min(ymd(lc_survey$submit_date_utc))` and `r max(ymd(lc_survey$submit_date_utc))`. 
Overall `r nrow(lc_survey)` responses were collected; all respondents shared some information about their experiences with The Carpentries. About two thirds contributed as an individual (`r tab_respondent_role$n[2]` responses), `r tab_respondent_role$n[1]` as a representative of a member institution and further `r tab_respondent_role$n[3]` respondents did not specify a role. 

```{r engagement}

n_not_yet_learn <- sum(!is.na(lc_survey$we_are_not_involved_yet_but_would_like_to_learn_more))

```

Overall, `r n_engagement` respondents reported that their library already engages with The Carpentries, and several do so in multiple ways. In addition, `r n_not_yet_learn` respondent libraries are not involved yet but they would like to learn more. 

Regarding their job roles, respondents were asked to choose up to three work areas. 

```{r job roles, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}

Of all respondents, `r n_workshop_att` had attended at least one Carpentries workhop.  Most popular was Library Carpentry (73 respondents), followed by Software Carpentry (42 respondents) and Data Carpentry (38 respondents). Out of these about every second (45 respondents) had attended at least two types of Carpentry workshops.

### Adopted routines

Respondents were asked to assess to what degree they have adopted certain behaviours or routines as a result of having completed a Carpentries workshop. The scale of responses was a 7-point Likert scale between never (0), sometimes (3, mid-point) and regularly (6), not all levels were spelled out in the survey questionnaire. The additional levels can be read as very rarely (1), rarely (2), often (4), very often (5). 

```{r routines, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9}

# Q9 In this series of 8 questions, you will be asked to rate which of the following behaviours/routines you have adopted as a result of completing a Carpentries workshop. Please select the option most consistent with your practices.
# Likert type question
# 0 Never, 3 Sometimes, 6 Regularly 
# 1 Very rarely, 2 Rarely
